# Azure - Building a Honeynet and SOC using Cloud Capabilities

## Introduction

In the project, I use Microsoft Azure to build a Honeynet and Security Operations Center (SOC). I then simulate an attack on the resources within Cloud system and Honeynet, and expose the VMs for 12 hours for which I document the security metrics. After analyzing, containing, eradicating the security incidents generated from my Cloud based SIEM, and recovering the systems, I further harden the system. The system is monitored for another 12 hours and measured again to see the effectiveness of the improvements.


<b>Purpose of my Lab is as follows:</b>

<li>To explore Cloud Vendor capabilities with Azure: 
<br>Azure Sentinel, Log Analytics Workspace, Microsoft Defender for Cloud, Azure AD (currently Entra ID)</li>
<li>To build and simulate a SOC with SIEM and Threat Intelligence capabilities and use it for Security Incident Responses according to NIST 800-61</li>
<li>To build a honeynet and examine live attack attempts and traffic</li>
